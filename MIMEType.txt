 How do I get IIS10 to support WCF services?

1. First add MIME type: extension ". svc", MIME Type "Application/octet-stream":

2. Then add the managed Handler (add managed handler) in "Handler Mappings (Handler mapping)":

Request Path: *.svc

Type:System.ServiceModel.Activation.HttpHandler

name:svc-integrated
